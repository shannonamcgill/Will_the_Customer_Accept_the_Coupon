# Will_the_Customer_Accept_the_Coupon
The purpose of this assignment was to review the attributes associated with influencing a customer to purchase a product. THe coupons were delivered while the potentioal was out driving. The dataset included but was not limited to customers with varying degree levels, education levels, marital status, spending habits, weather, and time of day the coupon was electronically delivered. The Jupyter Notebook I used to complete this assignment can be found here.

My initial steps were to review the data in order to better understand what columns were present and identify any required clean up. From this step, I decided to remove one of the columns as it was over 99% empty. 

I then reviewed the coupon distribution amoungsts different reasturant types. This can nicely be displayed using
